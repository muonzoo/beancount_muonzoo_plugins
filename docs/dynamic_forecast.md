# Dynamic Forecast

This plugin extends the (legacy)
[`forecast.py`](https://github.com/beancount/beancount/blob/v2/beancount/plugins/forecast.py)
plugin with context and evaluation of posting capabilities. Using metadata,
beancount users can populate a context dictionary with inventories and balances,
along with track events in order to compute a posting `Amount` that varies with
the up-to-date state of the beancount journal.
